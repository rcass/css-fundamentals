# Why CSS?

__CSS__ (Cascading Style Sheets) is what we use to control the appearance of our web pages.
It has two main usages. The first is to control typography (font, size, text style, color, etc.), and the second is to alter the layout and position of elements within an HTML document. It can also control the background (color or image) of any element.

The __CSS__ language is designed to help developers write generalized rules that apply to multiple elements in a page. The idea is that styles for any given element should be consistent across a site, so we should only have to define that style in one place. CSS is what allows it to be applied everywhere.
