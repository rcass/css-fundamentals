# CSS Rule-sets

```css
/* Example 1 */
p {
  color: red;
}

/* Example 2 */
header {
  position: fixed;
  height: 50px;
  background-color: grey;
}
```

A CSS __rule-set__ consists of a selector and a declaration block.

In Example 1 on the right, the selector is `p`, and the rule-set is everything including and between the curly braces. In this case, we are styling the text to be red.

In Example 2, the selector is `header`. As you can probably guess, we are styling the header's position, height, and background color.
