# Learn More!

MDN (Mozilla Developer Network) has the [best online resource for CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference).

It is well-maintained and very descriptive, but sometimes can be a bit overkill for beginners.
In the sections below we've outlined some of the more common elements you'll use while writing CSS.
The documentation for each one can be found on MDN.

## Typography

CSS allows us incredible contol over the text on our pages.

Common Rules:

`font`, `font-family`, `font-size`, `font-weight`, `text-decoration`, `text-align`, `line-height`

## Box Model

When the browser renders our HTML, it essentially renders [nested boxes](https://redacademy.github.io/html-fundamentals/#nesting-boxes) onto the screen.
The __Box Model__ is the set of rules used to determine the size and orientation of those boxes.

Common Rules:

`width`, `height`, `margin`, `margin-[left/right/top/bottom]`, `padding`, `padding-[left/right/top/bottom]`, `border`, `border-[left/right/top/bottom]`

- [Basics of the CSS Box Model](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/basics-of-the-css-box-model--cms-25322)

## Positioning

The Box Model defines the majority of layout in an HTML document, but sometimes we need items to behave in very specific ways.
We can change whether an item is `inline` or `block`, for example, or whether is should be rendered outside of the flow of the rest of the elements on the page!

Common Rules:

 `display`, `position`, `float`, `clear`, `flex`

## Backgrounds

CSS allows us to alter the background of any element, we can use colours, images, gradients, even video for backgrounds.

Common Rules:

- `background`, `background-position`, `background-image`, `background-color`, `background-repeat`
