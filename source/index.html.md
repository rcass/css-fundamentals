# CSS Fundamentals

At RED, we ask you to learn CSS _very_ fast.
It is impossible to get all of the ideas, patterns, and syntax right away.
This resource is here to help.

## Prerequisites

It is strongly recommended that you read the [HTML Fundamentals Wiki](https://redacademy.github.io/html-fundamentals/) before continuing.
